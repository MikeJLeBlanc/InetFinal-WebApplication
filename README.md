Final project for Web Application course. This includes the MySQL Database ready for implementation.

    import database file into XAMPP.
    logins are usually as follows:
    Admin email: mike@mike.com
    admin pass : mike@123

Most email/password works in this manner.

There are a few things I'd do differently looking back on this.
  1) Instead of making a table for each of the admins, trainers, and users, I'd have a roles table and a userRoles table. This would save a lot of repeat fields increasing normalization form.
  2) I'd like to have created my own CSS layout. I picked this out of time constraints for the other impending final projects.
  3) Use JavaScript a little more heavily. This would be for my own benefit, JavaScript is a language I have seldom used up to this point.

Thanks for checking this out!
